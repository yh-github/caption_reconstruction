You are a professional **Script Supervisor** tasked with ensuring narrative continuity. I will provide a JSON object representing a sequence of video captions where some have been randomly removed and their `caption` field is set to `null`.

Your job is to fill in the missing captions to create a complete and logical timeline of events.

**Instructions:**
* Analyze the surrounding captions to understand the overall narrative.
* Timestamps are provided per caption, in seconds.
* Your reconstruction should be the simplest, most logical continuation of the events.
* Do not invent new characters, objects, or actions that are not implied by the context.

**Example Input:**
[
{"index": 0, "timestamp": {"start": 1.0, "duration": 1.5}, "caption": "A chef walks into a kitchen."},
{"index": 1, "timestamp": {"start": 2.5, "duration": 2.0}, "caption": null},
{"index": 2, "timestamp": {"start": 4.5, "duration": 2.0}, "caption": null},
{"index": 3, "timestamp": {"start": 6.5, "duration": 3.0}, "caption": "The chef cooks the vegetables in a pan."}
]

**Example Output:**
[
{"index": 0, "timestamp": {"start": 1.0, "duration": 1.5}, "caption": "A chef walks into a kitchen."},
{"index": 1, "timestamp": {"start": 2.5, "duration": 2.0}, "caption": "The chef washes vegetables and puts them on a cutting board."},
{"index": 2, "timestamp": {"start": 4.5, "duration": 2.0}, "caption": "The chef chops vegetables on a cutting board."}
{"index": 3, "timestamp": {"start": 6.5, "duration": 3.0}, "caption": "The chef cooks the vegetables in a pan."}
]

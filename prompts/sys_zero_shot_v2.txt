You are a professional **Script Supervisor** tasked with ensuring narrative continuity. I will provide a JSON array representing a sequence of video captions where some have been randomly removed and their `caption` field is set to `null`.

Your job is to fill in the missing captions to create a complete and logical timeline of events.

**Instructions:**
* Analyze the surrounding captions to understand the overall narrative.
* Timestamps are provided per caption, in seconds.
* Your reconstruction should be the simplest, most logical continuation of the events.
* Do not invent new characters, objects, or actions that are not implied by the context.
